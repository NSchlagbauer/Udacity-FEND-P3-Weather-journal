--THIS IS OBSOLETE, the new version doesn't have country codes anymore - left for history purposes--

When working with only ZIP codes, OpenWeather API seems to be less exact with location than with country code/ZIP code combination and finding geocoordinates via Geocoding API.
This is why I included the country code field.

When entering country codes, it is important to use the 2-letter Alpha-2 ISO 6113 country codes.
I've included a link to ISO.org's list of country codes on my project page. Please use the 2-letter-codes provided there.
I'll also provide the link here, so all information is compiled here in the README: https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/
